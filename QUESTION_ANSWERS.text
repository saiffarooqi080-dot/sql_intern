What is normalization?
It's a design technique for organizing database tables to reduce data duplication and improve data integrity by splitting large tables into smaller, linked ones.

Primary vs Foreign Keys?
A primary key is the unique identifier for each record within its own table. A foreign key is a column in one table that points to the primary key in another table, acting as a link.

What are constraints?
Constraints are rules that validate data before it's allowed into a table. They enforce data accuracy by setting limits, like ensuring a value is unique or not empty.

What is a surrogate key?
A surrogate key is an artificial primary key, usually just a unique number, that has no business meaning. Its only job is to uniquely identify a row.

How do you avoid data redundancy?
You avoid redundancy by applying normalization. This means you store a piece of information (like a name) in only one table and then reference it elsewhere using a key, rather than re-typing it.

What is an ER diagram?
An Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram is a flowchart that visually maps out the database structure, showing the tables (entities) and how they connect (their relationships).

What are the types of relationships in DBMS?
There are three types: one-to-one (one record links to one other), one-to-many (one record links to multiple others), and many-to-many (multiple records link to multiple others).

Purpose of AUTO_INCREMENT?
Its purpose is to automatically generate a unique, sequential number for a new row. This is typically used to create a simple, hands-off primary key.

What is the default storage engine in MySQL?
The default storage engine is InnoDB. It's preferred because it robustly supports transactions, foreign keys, and crash recovery, which are vital for data reliability.

What is a composite key?
A composite key is a primary key that requires two or more columns combined to create a unique identifier for a row. No single column in the key is unique by itself, but their combination is.
